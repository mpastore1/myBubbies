<h2 class="centered" style="color:black; font-size:1.7vw;" >I met my bubbies on March 12, 2020, and we went to the aroma espresso bar. <br>
My bubbies and I had tuna sandwiches and large coffees. That day we loved spending so much time together<b>
we decided to go watch a movie(we watched the invisible man). On March 17th Ontario went into its first<br>
lockdown and we didn't see each other after for a while. Then on May 15th, I texted my bubbies asking to go for a walk<br>
and we went on to venturing into forest trails which we still enjoy, even today. From then on we took up picnicking and tried as many restaurants as we could<br>
then on June 26th, we traveled to Oshawa at Gordon Richards Park on the waterfront where we kissed for the first time.&#10084; <br>
Then on this day, July 1st we made our love for each other official and I couldn't be happier. &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;   &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;  </h2>
